## Smart Webhook Digest | n8n Workflow

A powerful and customizable n8n workflow that collects data from multiple webhook sources (like form submissions, monitoring alerts, or API events) and bundles them into a single, organized digest message. The digest is sent on a schedule to your preferred channel (e.g., Slack, Email), reducing notification noise and providing a clear daily summary.
