## Smart Webhook Digest | n8n Workflow

A powerful and customizable n8n workflow that collects data from multiple webhook sources (like form submissions, monitoring alerts, or API events) and bundles them into a single, organized digest message. The digest is sent on a schedule to your preferred channel (e.g., Slack, Email), reducing notification noise and providing a clear daily summary.

-Multiple Outputs: Send the digest to Slack, Email, Microsoft Teams, or any other supported n8n service.

-Fully Customizable: Easily modify the code logic to format the digest, add new sources, or change conditions.

-Low-Code: Built visually in n8n with minimal JavaScript required.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### The workflow is built on a simple but powerful principle: Collect now, process later.

-Collection: Dedicated webhook nodes act as endpoints, receiving and storing payloads from external services.

-Trigger: A scheduler node (e.g., a daily cron job) activates the workflow.

-Processing: The workflow fetches all data received since the last trigger, processes it (e.g., counts events, formats messages), and generates a summary.

-Delivery: The final digest is sent to a notification channel like Slack.
